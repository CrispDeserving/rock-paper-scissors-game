# rock-paper-scissors-game

A simple game made with Javascript (currently printed at the console).

## How to run?

There is a live version [here.](https://crispdeserving.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-game/)
Going there, run `game()` in the browser console.

## Potential Improvements

- Could be more generalized with arrays and mappings.

    *Rock, paper, scissors, spock, anyone?*

    ***This could also make refactoring easier for the future.***
